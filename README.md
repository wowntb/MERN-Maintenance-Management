# MERN Maintenance Management App

This is an app built with Node, Express, and React. This is the first project I've built using the MongoDB driver so that makes this my first fullstack MERN application.

## Instructions

1. In the server directory run the command "npm install" to download the dependencies, then run  "npm start" to initialise the backend.
2. In the client directory run the command "npm install" again to download the frontend's dependencies, then run "npm start" to start the frontend and open the app in the browser.
